# ASL-Fingerspelling-Project

In this project , we have implemented ASL fingerspelling and built a tool that converts from signs to letters , letters to text and then ultimately text to speech.

We have used the standard mnist ASL sign language dataset available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist
